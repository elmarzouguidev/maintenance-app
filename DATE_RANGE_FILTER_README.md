# Date Range Filter for Tickets

## Overview
This implementation adds a date range filter to the Ticket index page, allowing users to filter tickets by creation date range.

## Features
- **Start Date Filter**: Filter tickets created from a specific date
- **End Date Filter**: Filter tickets created up to a specific date
- **Date Range Filter**: Filter tickets within a specific date range
- **Individual Date Filters**: Use start date or end date independently
- **French Date Format**: Uses dd-mm-yyyy format
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid date formats

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### Filter Form (`resources/views/theme/pages/Ticket/__datatable/__filters.blade.php`)
- Added two date input fields: "Date de dÃ©but" and "Date de fin"
- Uses Bootstrap Datepicker with French localization
- Maintains existing filter state on page reload

#### JavaScript (`resources/views/theme/pages/Ticket/__datatable/__js_filters.blade.php`)
- Added `getStartDateFilter()` and `getEndDateFilter()` functions
- Updated `filterResults()` to include date range parameters
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 2. Backend Changes

#### Model Scopes (`app/Models/Scopes/TicketScopes.php`)
- `scopeFiltersStartDate()`: Filters tickets created from start date
- `scopeFiltersEndDate()`: Filters tickets created up to end date
- `scopeFiltersDateRange()`: Filters tickets within date range
- Added error handling for invalid date formats

#### Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/Administration/Ticket/TicketController.php`)
- Updated `index()` method to use new date range filters
- Updated `oldTow()` method to use new date range filters
- Replaced old single date filter with start/end date filters

## Usage

### Filter by Date Range
1. Select a start date in "Date de dÃ©but" field
2. Select an end date in "Date de fin" field
3. Click "filter" button
4. Results will show tickets created between the selected dates

### Filter by Start Date Only
1. Select only a start date
2. Leave end date empty
3. Results will show tickets created from the start date onwards

### Filter by End Date Only
1. Select only an end date
2. Leave start date empty
3. Results will show tickets created up to the end date

### Combine with Other Filters
- Date range filters work with all existing filters (Client, Status, Etat, Retour)
- Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously

## Technical Specifications

### Date Format
- **Input Format**: dd-mm-yyyy (e.g., 25-12-2024)
- **Database Query**: Uses Carbon for date parsing and comparison
- **Timezone**: Uses application's configured timezone

### Database Queries
- **Start Date**: `WHERE created_at >= start_date 00:00:00`
- **End Date**: `WHERE created_at <= end_date 23:59:59`
- **Date Range**: `WHERE created_at BETWEEN start_date 00:00:00 AND end_date 23:59:59`

### Error Handling
- Invalid date formats are gracefully ignored
- Empty date fields are not included in the filter
- Database queries continue to work even with malformed dates

## Browser Compatibility
- Works with all modern browsers
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Uses Bootstrap Datepicker for consistent UI

## Future Enhancements
- Add date validation on frontend
- Add "Clear Filters" button
- Add date range presets (Last 7 days, Last 30 days, etc.)
- Add export functionality for filtered results
